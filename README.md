# TowersOfHanoi

The game Towers of Hanoi consists of three pegs and a collection of rings that stack on the pegs. The rings are different sizes. 
 
The rings are stacked in decreasing order of their size, and the second and third towers are initially empty. During the game, the child may transfer rings one at a time from the top of one peg to the top of another. The goal is to move all the rings from the first peg to the second peg. The difficulty is that the child may not place a ring on top of one with a smaller diameter. There is the one extra peg to hold rings temporarily, but the prohibition against a larger ring on a smaller ring applies to it as well as to the other two pegs.
Assignment:
Create a class Towers that implements the game Towers of Hanoi with three pegs.
